					<h4>About Me</h4>
                        <p>
                        	Good day visitor! My name is Rohaan Allport and I am here to  help you learn and expand 
                            your knowledge of some popular computer programs.  Most notably, Adobe Flash CS4 and 
                            above.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                        	Origin
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                        	My friends and I love computers. We appreciate all aspects  of Computer Science (even the 
                            parts we don't particularly like), and we plan on  majoring in it at University.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	While still in high school my friends and I wanted to make a  website where we could upload 
                            content such as animation, gadgets, games, videos,  widgets, music and comics that we 
                            create/created and allow people such as  yourself to either use on the web or download on to 
                            your Hard Drive. Those  ideas are finally coming into place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	I first started this Website as a school assignment for my Introduction  to HTML and Web 
                            design&nbsp;course at college. Then I thought&nbsp;Hey! if I'm  already doing a website for school, and I 
                            have no restriction, I might as well  just start making the website my friends and I want to 
                            make. I practiced my  HTML almost every day and created some interesting graphics that 
                            would match  the theme I used for my youTube channel (Borris123PSN's channel).
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                        	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Borris123PSN">YouTube Channel</a>
						</h4>
                        <p>
                        	I made my youTube channel a while back but only started uploading videos about a year 
                            later. I upload Flash CS4/CS5 video tutorials. The most popular ones however are the 
                            Platform game tutorials. A short time after I uploaded my first two Platform game Tutorials, 
                            I created a logo for myself and made a theme for my channel. I also made a short intro for my 
                            videos. My youTube channel currently has all my video tutorials I have made and I will 
                            continue to upload Tutorials.
